# Dallas Microgreens

Simple e-commerce website for my microgreens business. This website is part of my larger project to innovate the growing process of migrogreens in microfarms.

(Currently not taking customers, but enjoying the creative and engineering processes involved).

- The website has 7 microgreen varieties available for order through a custom **TypeScript/Angular** shopping cart. 
- Customers login to their account through **AWS Cognito**.
- One-time payments and subscriptions are paid through **Stripe integrations**.
- **Lambda and DynamoDB** make **RESTful API** requests seamless and easy.

This website pairs with my custom designed, CAD-ed and, 3D printed microgreen growing trays (and watering system) that automates watering and lighting from germination to harvest.
<ins>The goal has been to expedite/automate as much of the growing and harvesting of microgreens as possible. </ins>
In the future, I plan to automate the harvesting, cleaning of the custom grow trays, and re-seeding processes with a robotic track. (already started, but this process will take many more iterations).

What are Microgreens?
Microgreens are young, edible greens that come from sprouting the seeds of various vegetable and herb plants.
They can be very nutritious, containing up to 40 times more vitamins and a wider range of antioxidants than their adult counterparts.
